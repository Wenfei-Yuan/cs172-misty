#How to use

## Create a .github folder under your repo if you dont hve one

## Drag the instructions folder into the .github folder

## Add this to your VS Code settings.json to ensure the folders are scanned:

{
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    ".github/instructions": true,  %% this should be the relative path to your repo if you have multi-repos in the ws
    ".claude/rules": true
  }
}

## initialize the repo using initialize.md with prompt:
following the instructions in @.github/instructions/workflow/initialize.instructions.md to initialize the repo [repo name]

## then it will automatically generates files that keeps logs of system overview, functionality updates, bug logs, known issues, and past Q&A. 

## then, when you have new requests, the copilot agent should follow the corresponding instructions (**If you want to be 100% sure that copilots follows the instructions**, drag the instruction.md to the chat window and use the request templates in the general folder)

# Ongoing:

The master.instructions.md is not working perfectly

sometime it would not use the instructions.md sometimes if the user does not use the reuqest template

create prompts for generating a .claude.md that logs all mistatkes that claude has made to prevent future errors in general.
